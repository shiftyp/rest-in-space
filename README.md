# üöÄ REST in Space: API Lab

Welcome to the REST API Lab! This hands-on exercise will introduce you to RESTful API concepts and Express.js, a Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs.

## üîé Overview

This lab consists of three parts:
1. **API, Node.js, Express.js Overview**: A [quick overview](setup.md) of the concepts and technologies we'll use in this lab.

2. **SpaceTraders API Exploration**: Interact with a real-world RESTful API using Postman to understand API design principles, authentication, and resource manipulation.

2. **Express.js API Implementation**: Complete a partially built Express.js API for managing fictional space resources, implementing three core REST operations (GET, POST, PUT).

## üìñ Learning Objectives

- Understand RESTful API principles and best practices
- Experience working with a production API (SpaceTraders.io)
- Learn how to implement a RESTful API using Express.js
- Practice handling HTTP methods, routes, and responses
- Gain familiarity with API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger

## üìù Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (or using the provided IDX environment)
- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- Postman installed (or Postman Web)
- A SpaceTraders.io account (you'll create this during the lab)

## üî∞ Getting Started

### Part 1: SpaceTraders API Exercise

1. Navigate to the `space-traders` directory
2. Follow the instructions in `exercise.md`
3. We'll complete the exercise as a group, and final "quiz" in assigned breakout groups

### Part 2: Express.js API Implementation

1. Navigate to the `express-api` directory
2. Follow the instructions in `exercise.md` individually
3. Implement the missing endpoints in the Space Resource API leveraging the documentation and teaching staff to guide your implementation
4. Test your implementation using the Swagger documentation (which when your server is running is located at [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs), or a proxied URL on IDX)
