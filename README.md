# REST API Lab

Welcome to the REST API Lab! This hands-on exercise will introduce you to RESTful API concepts and Express.js, a popular Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs. This lab is designed for Computer Science students who are familiar with JavaScript but haven't worked with Node.js or Express before.

## Overview

This lab consists of two parts:

1. **SpaceTraders API Exploration**: Interact with a real-world RESTful API using Postman to understand API design principles, authentication, and resource manipulation.

2. **Express.js API Implementation**: Complete a partially built Express.js API for managing fictional space resources, implementing the core REST operations (GET, POST, PUT).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand RESTful API principles and best practices
- Experience working with a production API (SpaceTraders.io)
- Learn how to implement a RESTful API using Express.js
- Practice handling HTTP methods, routes, and responses
- Gain familiarity with API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- Postman installed (or Postman Web)
- A SpaceTraders.io account (you'll create this during the lab)

## Getting Started

### Part 1: SpaceTraders API Exercise

1. Navigate to the `space-traders` directory
2. Follow the instructions in `exercise.md`
3. Complete the exercise and group quiz

### Part 2: Express.js API Implementation

1. Navigate to the `express-api` directory
2. Follow the instructions in `exercise.md`
3. Implement the missing endpoints in the Space Resource API
4. Test your implementation using the Swagger documentation
