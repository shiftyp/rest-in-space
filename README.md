# üöÄ REST in Space: API Lab

Welcome to this REST API Lab! This hands-on exercise will introduce you to RESTful API concepts and Express.js, a Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs.

## üî∞ Who this lab is for

This lab will be easier to attempt if you have some experience with the following:

- **Required:** Programming in JavaScript; doesn't need to be advanced but we'll be programming with it
- **Required:** Running terminal commands (bash); we'll be runnning commands using the terminal
- **Optional:** Version control wtih `git`; does anyone _really_ know git? :smile: The git commands are shown, so you can follow along!
- **Optional:** Reading / writing JSON (JavaScript Object Notation); we'll be reading it, but if you know JavaScript you'll pick it up
- **Optional:** Frontend API Integration with `fetch`; not part of this lab, but good to know APIs from the client side


## üîé Overview

This lab consists of three parts:
1. **API, Node.js, Express.js Overview**: Listening to a [quick overview](setup.md) lecture on the concepts and technologies we'll use in this lab.

2. **SpaceTraders API Exploration**: Working as a group to interact with a real-world RESTful API using Swagger UI to understand API design principles, authentication, and resource manipulation.

3. **Express.js API Implementation**: Working individually Complete a partially built Express.js API for managing fictional space resources, implementing three core REST operations (GET, POST, PUT).

## üìñ Learning Objectives

- Understand RESTful API principles and best practices
- Experience working with a production API (SpaceTraders.io)
- Learn how to implement a RESTful API using Express.js
- Practice handling HTTP methods, routes, and responses
- Gain familiarity with API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger

## üìù Prerequisites

- A Google account with Firebase Studio enabled
- [A clone of this repository in Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/new?template=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshiftyp%2Frest-in-space)
- Node.js installed (or using the provided Firebase Studio environment)
- Swagger UI (included in the project)
- A SpaceTraders.io account (you'll create this during the lab)

## üßëüèæ‚ÄçüöÄ Getting Started

### Part 1: SpaceTraders API Exercise

1. Navigate to the `space-traders` directory
2. Follow the instructions in `exercise.md`
3. We'll complete the exercise as a group, and the discussion questions in assigned breakout groups

### Part 2: Express.js API Implementation

1. Navigate to the `express-api` directory
2. Follow the instructions in `exercise.md` individually
3. Implement the missing endpoints in the Space Resource API leveraging the documentation and teaching staff to guide your implementation
4. Test your implementation using the Swagger documentation (which when your server is running is located at [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs), or a proxied URL on Firebase Studio)
